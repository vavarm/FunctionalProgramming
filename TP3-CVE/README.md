# TP3 - CVE

Scala project in which we import json files and process an ETL on them to collect only one simplified json output.

## Note

The input data were to large for the repository. Please, create a `data-in` directory in the root folder and put the json files from the website `https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds` in this directory.
